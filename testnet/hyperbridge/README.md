# hyperbridge

Secure interoperability requires the verification of consensus proofs, consensus fault proofs, and state transition validity proofs. Blockchains that want to securely communicate with each other must perform these operations onchain, so that they can be convinced of the finalized (irreversible) state of their counterparty. Finally, through the use of state proofs, they are then able to read the outgoing message queue of their counter party.
