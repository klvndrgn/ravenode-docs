WAKU IS UNCOMPROMISING WEB3 COMMUNICATION AT SCALE A family of robust, censorship-resistant communication protocols designed to enable privacy-focused messaging for web3 apps.

Waku is powering the communication layer of the Logos technology stack. Logos is a grassroots movement, building the infrastructure for trust-minimised, corruption-resistant governing services and social institutions for peaceful people worldwide. Learn more about our ambitious vision.

Nwaku is a lightweight and robust Nim client for running a Waku node, equipped with tools to monitor and maintain a running node. Nwaku is highly configurable, enabling operators to select the [protocols](https://docs.waku.org/learn/concepts/protocols) they want to support based on their needs, motivations, and available resources.

This guide provides detailed steps to download, build, configure, and connect a `nwaku` node to the Waku Network. It also includes interacting with the node and finding its addresses.

We recommend running a `nwaku` node with at least 2GB of RAM, especially if you have `WSS` enabled. If running just a `Relay` node, 0.5GB of RAM is sufficient.
