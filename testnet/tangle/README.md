# Tangle

Tangle enables by validator restaking, Tangle provides an ideal framework for application development that prioritizes privacy through the secure computation of private inputs.

Tangle platform supports an array of critical services tailored for developers working on advanced Zero-Knowledge (ZK) and cross-chain solutions. Central to that is the fusion of cross-chain interoperability, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, sophisticated governance protocols, and ZK services.

These services include zkSNARKS-as-a-Service (zk-SNARKsaaS) and Trusted Setups-as-a-Service, as well as non-ZK MPC services like Threshold Signature Schemes as-a-Service (TSSaaS) and threshold encryption. Together, these strengths set the stage for an era of rapid implementation of privacy-centric applications.
