# Dusk

Dusk is powered by cutting-edge technology, engineered for the inception and deployment of disintermediated services and decentralized applications with a specific focus on the financial sector, both traditional and alternative.

Technically, Dusk is a [layer one](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/layer-1-in-blockchain), [zero-knowledge friendly](https://dusk.network/news/understanding_zkps-what-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter/), [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) blockchain network protocol with an emphasis on privacy and compliance.

#### Prover Specifications <a href="#prover-specifications" id="prover-specifications"></a>

Prover requirements are dependant on the amount of workers a server can run in parallel. Single-threaded performance is key to generate proofs as quickly as possible.

**Minimum**

| CPU             | RAM  | Storage | Network Connection |
| --------------- | ---- | ------- | ------------------ |
| 4 cores; +2 GHz | 8 GB | 20 GB   | 20 Mbps            |

#### Provisioner Specifications <a href="#provisioner-specifications" id="provisioner-specifications"></a>

These specifications are set to comfortably accommodate provisioner and full nodes, with limited proving capabilities.

For increased network throughput, the node benefits from highly performant single-threaded performance.

| CPU            | RAM  | Storage | Network Connection |
| -------------- | ---- | ------- | ------------------ |
| 2 cores; 2 GHz | 4 GB | 50 GB   | 10 Mbps            |
